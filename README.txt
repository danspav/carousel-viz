#Who is this app for?#
This app is for anyone who wants to display several metrics on a small area of a dashboard.

#How does the app work?#
This app provides a visualization that you can use in your own apps and dashboards.

To use it in your dashboards, simply install the app, and create a search that provides the values you want to display.

#Usecases for the Departures Board Visualization:#
- Displaying current server metrics like CPU, Memory, I/O, and Disk usage
- Scrolling through a list of sales by category or date
- Showing related application metrics in a discreet dashboard panel
- Rotating through all open Priority 1 ticket numbers

#The following fields can be used in the search:#
- value (required): If you don't define a field called value, the first field will be used to display the value text.
- unit (optional): You can define a unit for the value, e.g. '$' or '%'. A value in the unit field will override the default unit configured in settings.
- caption (optional): A caption to display for this value. If you define a caption field, it will override the default caption configured in settings.
- range (optional): This is usually generated by the rangemap command. It is used to set the color for the slide.

#Example Search#
| makeresults count=5 
| streamstats count as id
| eval value=case(id==1,42.4, id==2,74, id==3,"2", id==4,"55",id==5,"622") 
| eval unit=case(id==1,"%", id==2,"MB", id==3,"%", id==4,"Mbps",id==5,"Users") 
| eval caption=case(id==1,"CPU Use", id==2,"Free Memory", id==3,"Free Disk Space", id==4,"Network Use",id==5,"Active Users") 
| eval range=case(id==1,"low", id==2,"elevated", id==3,"severe", id==4,"low",id==5,"low") 
| table value, unit, caption, range
